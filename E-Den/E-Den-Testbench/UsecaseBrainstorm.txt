TODO: Genetic clauses, can may have a processor, that processes them. conditions and actions get their parents (bodypart, chemstorage, etc) set by the clause during setProcessor method. If they run without set setup ... we will crash (assert)


Usecase:
- you always have 3 plants. 2 of one color 1 of the other. codes of those plants are stored persistant
- if a plant dies, you are shown the seeds that have been produced by your plants. You may chose one seed to become your next third plant, preserving the color rule.
- You may modify what part of the genetic code are mutated in which ranges.
